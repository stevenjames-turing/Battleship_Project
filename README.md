  5. When both of your ships have been placed, you will be shown a rendering of your board and your opponent’s (the computer) board.
  6. Follow the prompts to select the cells to fire upon.
  7. The computer’s board will update to reflect if you hit or missed a target and your board will update to reflect the computer’s attempted hits.
  8. You will continue until the first player sinks all of their opponent’s ships!
